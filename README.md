 "Advanced Learning  on Artificial Intelligence Applications for Health Data." 
These assignments are structured to facilitate the understanding and application of modern AI technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks. It is particularly relevant for professionals interested in applying AI methodologies to health data and other large data sets.

By reviewing all the material provided you will be able to: 
1. Understand the fundamental concepts and components of AI, machine learning, and deep learning
(neural networks).
2. Familiarize themselves with a wide range of popular, state-of-the-art AI models and their applications
in public health and other fields.
3. Comprehend the strengths, limitations, and tradeoffs of various AI models and be knowledgeable of
best practices for their implementation.
4. Use Python in combination with popular APIs and cloud platforms, such as Scikit-Learn, PyTorch,
PyTorch Lightning, fastai2, IceVision, Hugging Face Transformers, Google Colab, Kaggle, and Synthetic
Data Vault, to implement advanced AI models. These models include but are not limited to random
forest, XGBoost, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, transformers, and
generative adversarial networks, and they can be applied to diverse data types, including text, image,
and tabular data.
5. Apply AI models to solve real-world problems in health and social sectors
